# Day 9 – Network Basics & Security

## Commands Learned:

- `ifconfig` – View network interfaces and IP configuration.
- `ip a` – Modern alternative to `ifconfig`, shows detailed info.
- `ping <domain>` – Check if a host is reachable.
- `netstat -tuln` – View active TCP/UDP ports and listening services.
- `nslookup <domain>` – Find IP addresses of domain names (DNS lookup).

##  What I Learned:

Today I explored basic networking tools used in Linux. I learned how to:
- View IP configuration using `ip a` and `ifconfig`.
- Test connection to websites using `ping`.
- Check open network ports with `netstat`.
- Use `nslookup` to resolve domain names to IPs.

These tools are essential in cybersecurity for understanding network layout, identifying vulnerabilities, and troubleshooting issues.
